# Changelog

Here’s a summary of the recent updates made to the Task Generator page:

1. Integrated three separate task lists (`easy`, `normal`, `hard`) and updated the task generator to pick from the correct list based on the button clicked. -> Previously, it didn't pick out the tasks from the correct list.
2. Added full bilingual support—UI labels **and** the task texts themselves are now translated into English and Hungarian, with a language toggle.  
3. Introduced a “+1 try” button that lets the user gain back one remaining attempt when needed until the test phase ends. -> Previously, it would reset only at midnight.
4. Refactored the calendar and countdown logic to remain fully in sync with daily reset and user actions.
5. A History button was created to check the succesful and failed tasks.
6. Added a register AND login page.
